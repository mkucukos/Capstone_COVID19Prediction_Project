## Capstone_COVID19_Prediction_Project

A. Dataset: This dataset includes anonymised information from patients who visited the Hospital Israelita Albert 
Einstein in So Paulo, Brazil,  and had samples taken for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and other laboratory testing while they were there. 

B. Content: 

1. The exponential rise in the number of COVID cases threatened to overwhelm health systems worldwide with a demand 
for hospitalization and for ICU beds far above the capacity.

2. Testing every case with some mild symptoms, would be impractical in the context of an overburdened health system 
with the potential limitation to performing tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

C. Problems that were addressed: 

1. Based on the laboratory tests collected from the suspected cases, improve a classification 
model that predicts the chances of being positive/negative for covid19
2. What features could influence in the acceptance of patient into hospital?
